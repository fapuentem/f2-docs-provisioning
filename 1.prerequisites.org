Before starting the provisioning process, ensure you have the
following hardware, software, and tools available.

* Hardware Requirements

- *Jetson Orin Module*: Jetson Orin NX 8GB
- *Carrier Board:* F2 Carrier board v2.x and v3.x
- *Power Supply:*
  - Voltage: 12.5 - 15.0 V
  - Current: 5A or greater
- *USB Cable:*
  - Type: USB Type-A to Type-C.
  - Recommendation: A high-quality USB cable is recommended to avoid
    data transfer issues during flashing.
- *Host Computer:*
  - Operating System: Ubuntu GNU/Linux 18.04 LTS or 20.04 LTS is
    recommended for optimal compatibility with NVIDIA SDK Manager).
  - Processor: i5
  - RAM: 8GB or more recommended
  - Disk Space: At least 50GB free disk space for downloading and
    storing SDK components.
- *Ethernet Cable (Optional):* Recommended for a stable network
  connection during the initial setup and software installations. Your
  carrier board will need an Ethernet port.
- *Storage:*
  - Type: NVMe SSD
  - Size: 128GB or larger NVMe SSD.

* Software Requirements (on the Host Computer - Ubuntu)

- Update and upgrade repository.
  #+BEGIN_SRC shell :dir /sudo::
    apt update
    apt upgrade -y
 #+END_SRC

- Install requirements
  #+BEGIN_SRC shell :dir /sudo::
    apt install git
 #+END_SRC
- *NVIDIA SDK Manager:* Download and install the latest version of
  NVIDIA SDK Manager from the official NVIDIA repositories:
  1. Download the ~.deb~ package.
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell :dir ~/Downloads :results output
       # Compute NVIDIA's token: ubuntu1804 / 2004 / 2204 / 2404
       distro=$( . /etc/os-release; printf "ubuntu%s" "${VERSION_ID//./}" )

       echo "Using distro: $distro"
       wget "https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/${distro}/x86_64/cuda-keyring_1.1-1_all.deb"
     #+END_SRC

  2. Install ~.deb~ package
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell :dir /sudo::~/Downloads/
       dpkg -i cuda-keyring_1.1-1_all.deb
     #+END_SRC

  3. Install ~sdkmanager~
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell :dir /sudo::~/Downloads/
       apt-get update
       apt-get -y install sdkmanager
     #+END_SRC

- *Dependencies for SDK Manager:*
  - Ensure your Ubuntu system has the necessary dependencies
    installed. SDK Manager usually prompts for these during
    installation, but it's good to be aware. Common dependencies might
    include:
    - ~curl~
    - ~wget~
    - ~python3~
    - ~python3-pip~
    - ~rsync~
    - ~unzip~
    - ~zip~
    - You might need to enable the ~universe~ repository on your Ubuntu
      system if you haven't already:
      ,#+BEGIN_SRC sh
        sudo add-apt-repository universe
        sudo apt update
    #+END_SRC
- *Specific Python and pip versions:* SDK Manager might have specific
  requirements for Python and pip versions. It's generally recommended
  to use the versions that come with a recent stable Ubuntu
  release. If you encounter issues, consult the NVIDIA SDK Manager
  documentation for version compatibility.

* Tools

- *Screwdriver Set (if assembly is required):* Depending on your carrier
  board and Jetson module, you might need a screwdriver to secure the
  module or install storage.
- *ESD Protection (Wrist Strap):* Highly recommended to prevent
  electrostatic discharge that could damage sensitive electronic
  components during handling.
- Fanstel flasher board. It is required for carrier boards < v3.1.

Once you have gathered all the necessary prerequisites, you can
proceed with flashing the Jetson Orin module.
