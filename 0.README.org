* Purpose

This documentation set provides step-by-step instructions to prepare an Ubuntu host system, install the required tools, and flash the *F2 Smart Controller* (F2-SC01) based on the NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX module.

Each section is contained in a separate =.org= file to simplify navigation and maintenance.  The instructions are validated on Ubuntu 18.04 host systems.

* Scope

These documents focus on Visiontech’s in-house carrier board design.  The *F2-Smart-Controller* hardware integrates:

- Jetson Orin NX module (8GB or 16GB)
- Custom power and I/O management circuits
- Dual GbE, USB, and expansion connectors
- NVMe SSD and eMMC boot options

* Schematics for reference:

* Target Audience

This documentation is primarily intended for:

- Developers working with the *F2-Smart-Controller* platform.
- Engineers responsible for setting up and deploying *F2-Smart-Controller*.
- Technicians involved in the initial configuration and testing of the hardware.

A basic understanding of Linux command-line operations and embedded systems concepts is recommended.
