* Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive guide for provisioning a Jetson
Orin module on F2 carrier boards(v3.x). It outlines the necessary
steps to flash the operating system, perform initial system
configuration, set up networking, install essential software, and
configure any carrier board-specific functionalities.

* Target Audience

This documentation is primarily intended for:

- Developers working with the Jetson Orin platform.
- Engineers responsible for setting up and deploying Jetson Orin based
  systems.
- Technicians involved in the initial configuration and testing of the
  hardware.

A basic understanding of Linux command-line operations and embedded
systems concepts is recommended.

* Document Conventions

The following conventions are used throughout this document:

- *Code Blocks:* Commands to be executed in the terminal are displayed
  within ~src~ blocks:
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo apt update
  #+END_SRC

- *Important Notes:* Important information or considerations are
  highlighted as follows:
  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *IMPORTANT:* Ensure you have the correct power supply connected before
   proceeding.
  #+END_QUOTE

- *Warnings:* Steps that could potentially lead to data loss or system
  instability are marked with a warning:
  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *WARNING:* Incorrectly flashing the module can render it
   unusable. Double-check all steps before execution.
  #+END_QUOTE

- *Notes:* Additional helpful information or tips are presented as:
