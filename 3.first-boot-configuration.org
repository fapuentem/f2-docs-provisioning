After successfully flashing the Jetson Orin module, this section
guides you through the initial operating system setup.

* Powering On for the First Time

1. *Connect Serial Terminal:* It is highly recommended to connect to the
   Jetson Orin's serial console for the initial configuration and to
   monitor the boot process.

   a. *Connect USB Cable:* Connect a USB cable from your host computer
   to the designated terminal connector on your F2 carrier board
   (J15). Refer to your carrier board's documentation for the exact
   port.

   b. *Open Terminal on Host:* Open a terminal window on your Ubuntu
   host computer.

   c. *Use ~screen~ Command:* Use the ~screen~ command to establish a serial
   connection to the Jetson Orin. You might need to adjust
   ~/dev/ttyUSB0~ depending on the actual serial port assigned to your
   board.

      #+BEGIN_SRC sh
        sudo screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200
      #+END_SRC

   d. *Power On the Jetson Orin:* Connect the power supply to your F2
   carrier board.

   e. *Observe Boot Process:* You should see the boot messages scrolling
   in your ~screen~ session. This will allow you to monitor the startup
   process and identify any potential issues early on.

3. *Login:* Once the system has booted, you might be prompted for a
   login.

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   *user:* nvidia

   *password:* nvidia
   #+END_QUOTE


* Initial System Configuration

Once you have access to the Jetson Orin either through the serial
console, you can proceed with the initial system configuration.

1. *Update and Upgrade Packages:* It's a good practice to update the
   package lists and upgrade existing packages to the latest versions.

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get upgrade -y
   #+END_SRC

2. *Install Essential Software and Tools:* Install commonly used tools
   and libraries.

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     sudo apt-get install git curl python3-pip stm32flash jq libqmi-utils udhcpc htop sysstat python3.8-venv -y
   #+END_SRC
   - =git=: Version control system.
   - =curl=: Tool for transferring data with URLs.
   - =python3-pip=: Package installer for Python 3.
   - =stm32flash=: Utility for flashing STM32 microcontrollers.
   - =jq=: Command-line JSON processor.
   - =libqmi-utils=: Utilities for communicating with WWAN modems using the QMI protocol (useful for 5G modem like the Quectel RM520N-GL).
   - =udhcpc=: A small DHCP client.
   - =htop=: Interactive process viewer.
   - =sysstat=: Utilities for performance monitoring.
   - =python3.8-venv=: Creates lightweight virtual environments for Python.


3. *Install ~jetson-stats~:* This utility provides useful information
   about the Jetson's performance and resource usage.

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     sudo pip3 install -U jetson-stats
   #+END_SRC

4. *Install ~emacs~:* If you prefer the Emacs editor, you can install it
   using Snap.

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     sudo snap install emacs --classic --beta
   #+END_SRC

5. *Download Prelude*

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     curl -L https://git.io/epre | sh
   #+END_SRC

After completing these initial configuration steps, your Jetson Orin
module on the F2 carrier board should be ready for further network
configuration and software installations.

* Closing the Serial Terminal

To close the ~screen~ session on your host computer, press ~Ctrl+A~
followed by ~K~. You will be prompted to confirm if you want to kill the
window; type ~y~ and press Enter.
