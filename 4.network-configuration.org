This section describes how to configure network connectivity on your Jetson Orin F2 carrier board, including wired Ethernet, optional Wi-Fi, and configuration for a Quectel RM520N-GL 5G card.

* Wired Network Configuration

If you have connected an Ethernet cable to your F2 carrier board, it will typically attempt to obtain an IP address automatically using DHCP.

*DHCP Configuration:*

1. *Check Connection:* Ensure the Ethernet cable is securely connected to both the carrier board(/ETHERNET(Main)/ connector) and your network infrastructure (router, switch, etc.).

2. *Verify IP Address:* Open a terminal on your Jetson Orin and use the ~ip addr~ or ~ifconfig~ command to check if an IP address has been assigned to the Ethernet interface (usually ~eth2~).
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     ip addr show eth2
     # OR
     ifconfig eth2
   #+END_SRC
   Look for an ~inet~ address within the output. If you see an IP address starting with ~192.168.~, it likely means DHCP has successfully assigned an IP address.


* Wireless Network Configuration

F2 carrier board has Wi-Fi capabilities, you can connect to a wireless network.

*Scanning for Available Networks:*

Wi-Fi cards AX210 requieres of a small trick:
sudo mv /lib/firmware/iwlwifi-ty-a0-gf-a0.pnvm /lib/firmware/iwlwifi-ty-a0-gf-a0.pnvm.bck
#+END_COMMENT

1. *Enable Wi-Fi (if necessary):* Use the network management tools to ensure Wi-Fi is enabled.

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     sudo nmtui
   #+END_SRC

 2. *Scan for Networks:*

   This will display a list of available Wi-Fi networks (SSIDs).

*Connecting to a Network using ~wpa_supplicant~:*

You can use the ~wpa_supplicant~ tool to connect to a Wi-Fi network from the command line.

1. *Configure ~wpa_supplicant.conf~:* You might need to create or edit the ~/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf~ file.

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf
   #+END_SRC
   Add the following lines, replacing the placeholders with your network's SSID and password:

   #+BEGIN_SRC conf
     network={
         ssid="your_network_ssid"
         psk="your_wifi_password"
     }
   #+END_SRC

2. *Connect to Network:* Use the ~wpa_supplicant~ command to connect to the network. Replace ~wlan0~ with your Wi-Fi interface name.

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     sudo wpa_supplicant -i wlan0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf -B
   #+END_SRC

3. *Obtain IP Address:* Use ~dhclient~ to obtain an IP address from the Wi-Fi network.

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     sudo dhclient wlan0
   #+END_SRC

4. *Verify Connection:* Use ~ip addr show wlan0~ to check if an IP address has been assigned.

* Configuring Quectel RM520N-GL 5G Card

This section outlines the steps to configure a Quectel RM520N-GL 5G card connected to your F2 carrier board. This assumes the card is connected via a USB interface.

1. *Install ~qmi_wwan~ Driver:*
   - *Check if Driver Exists:* First, check if the ~qmi_wwan~ driver is already available on your system.

     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       modinfo qmi_wwan
     #+END_SRC

     If you see information about the driver, you can likely skip the manual installation.

   - *Manual Installation (if needed):* If the driver is not found, you might need to build it from source or obtain a pre-built kernel module. We already build it, and you can find th ~qmi_wwan.ko~ file in,

     #+BEGIN_SRC
       cd tools
       git clone https://github.com/fapuentem/f2-maintenance-tools.git
     #+END_SRC

     You can try loading it.

     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       modinfo ~/tools/f2-maintenance-tools/qmi_wwan.ko | more
       sudo cp qmi_wwan.ko /lib/modules/5.10.120-tegra/kernel/drivers/net/
       sudo depmod
       sudo modprobe qmi_wwan
     #+END_SRC

     - *Verify Driver Loaded:*

       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
         ls -lash /dev/cdc-wdm0
       #+END_SRC

       If the driver is loaded successfully, you should see a device file like ~/dev/cdc-wdm0~.

2. *Configure QMI Connection:* (using ~quectel-CM~):
   Source: [[https://www.embeddedpi.com/documentation/3g-4g-modems/quectel-connection-manager-quectel-cm-lte-ec25][Quectel Modem Connection Manager]]
   + Install missing package
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       sudo apt install dhcpcd5

       # Enable and start service
       sudo systemctl enable dhcpcd
       sudo systemctl start dhcpcd
     #+END_SRC

   + Download the tar package
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       cd ~/Downloads
       wget https://github.com/mypiandrew/quectel-cm/releases/download/V1.6.0.12/quectel-CM.tar.gz
       tar xvf quectel-CM.tar.gz
     #+END_SRC

   + Inside the ~quectel-CM~ directory,  we find bash scripts like ~install.sh~ and ~default.script~.

   + Change ~metric~ variable in line 20 in ~default.script~.

   + Change ~UDHCPC_DIR~ should be ~/etc/udhcpc/~. And run ~install.sh~ as sudo.

   + Test connection using:
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       quectel-CM -s internet.swir -f /var/log/quectel-CM.log
     #+END_SRC

   + Check status of the modem
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       mmcli -L
       mmcli -m x # x depends on the command above.
     #+END_SRC
* Verifying Network Connectivity

Once you have configured your network connection (wired, wireless, or 5G), you can verify connectivity using the ~ping~ command.

1. *Ping an External Host:* Try pinging a well-known website or IP address (e.g., Google's DNS server at ~8.8.8.8~).

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     ping -I wwan0 -c 4 8.8.8.8
   #+END_SRC

   If you receive replies, your network connection is likely working.

2. *Ping Your Router/Gateway:* Ping the IP address of your router or gateway to verify connectivity within your local network.

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     ping -c 4 your_router_ip_address
   #+END_SRC

Remember to replace placeholders like interface names (~eth0~, ~wlan0~, ~wwan0~), APNs, IP addresses, and file paths with the actual values relevant to your setup. Consult the documentation for your F2 carrier board and the Quectel RM520N-GL module for more specific information.
